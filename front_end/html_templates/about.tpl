          <br>This site is dedicated to videos I record teaching people Linux and Web things, tutorials I find around the internet, documentation I create, and other information related to Linux and the Web that I feel could be useful for the newbie. If you have suggestions on how to make this even greater, I'd love to hear them. Please feel free to leave a comment on one of the youtube videos for now. In time, I'll have a suggestion box here that you can fill out to reach me directly. </br> <br />-<a href="http://jessebot.com">Jesse</a></br>
